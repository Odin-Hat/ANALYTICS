# ANALYTICS

### About:
<p>I created a bash code inspired by some videos I watch from a channel called TDM</p>

<p>It talked about the `sed` command and the `bat` so I created a code that modifies any file with the `sed -i` command and displays the result with `bat`</p>

<p>In case you're curious, here's the link to the playlist I watched: <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV2Wfr3HZ9tiZPkFjcU9ztoIgDoqQzGbe">playlist</a></p>
<p>Subscribe to the Man channel for help</p>

<p>I made it thinking about users who, like me, don't have a computer to work with and still want to learn</p>

<p>It's simple but anyone who wants to help improve this code, all help is welcome!</p>

### How to install:

```
pkg install git
git clone https://github.com/Odin-Hat/TZANALYTICS
cd TZANALYTICS
chmod +x *
./main.bash

```

### How to use:

<p>The code will have to give you some options like: </p>

```
d = Delete row

e = Edit row

+l = add a new blank line

+lt = adds a new line with text
```

<p>After you choose, just answer some questions that will appear and after that the code does everything and prints the result</p>
